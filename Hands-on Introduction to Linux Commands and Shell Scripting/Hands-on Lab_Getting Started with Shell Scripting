Objectives
After completing this lab you will be able to:

Create and execute a simple bash shell script.
Implement the 'shabang' directive in a bash shell script.

--------------------


=====Exercise 1 - Create and execute a basic Shell Script


1.1 Create a new script file

--Step 1:  File->New File to create a new file.

--Step 2: Give the name as 'greet.sh' and click 'OK'

--Step 3: Copy and paste the following lines into the newly created file.

# This script accepts the user's name and prints 
# a message greeting the user

# Print the prompt message on screen
echo -n "Enter your name :"        

# Wait for user to enter a name, and save the entered name into the variable 'name'
read name                

# Print the welcome message followed by the name    
echo "Welcome $name"

# The following message should print on a single line. Hence the usage of '-n'
echo -n "Congratulations! You just created and ran your first shell script "
echo "using Bash on IBM Skills Network"


--Step 4: Save the file using the File->Save menu option


1.2 Execute the script

--Open a new terminal, 
--Let us check the permissions for this new file:

ls -l greet.sh

--If the file exists and has read permission, run the following command to execute it.

bash greet.sh


=====Exercise 2 - Using 'Shabang' line

In this exercise, we will edit the script 'greet.sh' created in the previous exercise and make it an executable file.


2.1 : Find the path to the interpreter.

--The which command helps you find out the path of the command 'bash'.

which bash

2.2 : Edit the script 'greet.sh' and add the shabang line to the script.

--Open the file and add the following line at the beginning of the script:

#! /bin/bash

2.3 Check the permissions of the script.

--Let us add the execute permission for the user on greet.sh.

chmod +x greet.sh

--To change permissions for greet.sh, run the command below:

chmod u+x greet.sh

--Verify the permissions using the command below.

ls -l greet.sh

2.4 Execute the script.

--Run the command given below to execute the shell script.

./greet.sh
